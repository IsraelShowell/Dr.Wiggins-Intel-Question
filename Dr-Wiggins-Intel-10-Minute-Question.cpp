Project Name: Dr.Wiggins' Intel Question
Description:
Dr.Wiggins' told us about his 10 minute Intel interview question, and I figured it out and wrote down the solution in 5 minutes on paper. 
The question was how many cycles does it take to count to 100 by 3's, and every 5th cycle, subtract 8. Dr.Wiggins did his in C, and I used C++. 
This is the code version of the program for my records.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

//Function Prototype
int cyclecount();

//Main function
int main() {

    //Cycles variable
    int cycles = 0;

    //Sets the value of cycles to the returned value
    cycles = cyclecount();

    //Prints out the number of cycles
    cout << "This is the number of cycles: " << cycles << endl;
}

int cyclecount() {

    //These are the needed variables
    int i = 0;
    int total = 0;
    int cycles = 0;

    //Could have used a for loop, but on paper I used a while loop.
    while (total < 100) {

        //Adds 3 to i's current value
        i += 3;

        //Adds i to total's current value
        total += i;

        //Each time this occurs, the number of cycles increases by 1
        cycles += 1;

        //Every 5th cycle, the 8 is subtracted from the total
        if (cycles % 5 == 0) {
            total -= 8;
        }

    }

    //This was used to prove that total was indeed at 100.
    cout << "The total is: " << total << endl;

    //This returns the 
    return cycles;

}
