# Project Name: Dr.Wiggins Intel Question
# Description:
Dr.Wiggins' told us about his 10 minute Intel interview question, and I figured it out and wrote down the solution in 5 minutes on paper. 
The question was how many cycles does it take to count to 100 by 3's, and every 5th cycle, subtract 8. Dr.Wiggins did his in C, and I used C++. 
This is the code version of the program for my records.
